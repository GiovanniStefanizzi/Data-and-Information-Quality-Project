## 🧹 Data Quality Enhancement — Error Injection and Cleaning in Python

This project was developed as part of the **Data and Information Quality** course and focuses on the evaluation and improvement of data quality through controlled error injection and cleaning techniques using **Python**.

### 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to simulate real-world data quality issues by intentionally introducing errors ("polluting" the dataset) and then applying a series of techniques to detect, analyze, and correct these issues.

The process is divided into three main phases:
1. **Error Injection**: Introduce controlled inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and formatting problems into a clean dataset.
2. **Quality Assessment**: Analyze the polluted dataset to quantify the degradation in data quality using various metrics.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Apply a range of techniques to restore data quality, including deduplication, imputation, standardization, and validation.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - Custom scripts for injecting and repairing data

### 📈 Evaluation

The effectiveness of the cleaning process was assessed by comparing:
- Pre- and post-cleaning statistics
- Manual verification on a sample of the restored data

### 🎯 Goals

- Simulate common real-world data quality problems
- Explore automated and semi-automated cleaning techniques
- Understand the impact of poor data quality on downstream analysis
